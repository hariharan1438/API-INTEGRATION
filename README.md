##This project is developed as part of CODTECH's Internship Task 1, which focuses on API Integration. The main objective of the task is to create a responsive webpage that connects to a public API (such as weather or news) and dynamically fetches and displays data to the user. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with emphasis on real-time data loading using the Fetch API. This project demonstrates how to work with external APIs, handle JSON responses, and update the user interface dynamically based on the fetched data. The final output is a clean, user-friendly webpage that reflects live data and is accessible across various devices. A completion certificate will be awarded by CODTECH at the end of the internship
